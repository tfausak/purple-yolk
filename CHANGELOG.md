## 2020-05-26: 0.0.10

- Fixed how GHCi is managed to avoid crashing when a buffer fills up. <https://github.com/tfausak/purple-yolk/issues/13>

## 2020-05-22: 0.0.6

- Stopped setting `-fdefer-type-errors`, `-fno-code`, and `-j` when starting GHCi. If you want these settings enabled, add them to your GHCi command.
- Change the job queue to avoid enqueueing duplicate jobs. This avoids repeatedly running `:reload` when you save multiple files. <https://github.com/tfausak/purple-yolk/issues/10>
- Changed diagnostics to clear when compiling that file, instead of clearing everything when a reload starts. This prevents some diagnostics from disappearing on reload. <https://github.com/tfausak/purple-yolk/issues/8>
- Changed the default command to set `-ddump-json`.
- Improved startup to more reliably capture warnings and errors.
